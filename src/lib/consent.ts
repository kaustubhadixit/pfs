// PatentSale — DPDPA consent language, defined ONCE and reused across the three
// consent touchpoints: lead capture form, buyer inquiry form, and (Prompt 3)
// the self-serve flow form. Reuse the shared <ConsentNotice /> component rather
// than reimplementing consent at each touchpoint.
//
// These strings are snapshot-stored on each Lead / BuyerInquiry record at
// submission time, so the exact consent language a user agreed to is preserved
// even if this constant is later edited.
