    // Tesla — reduced-bit neural-network architecture for embedded devices (Iandola)
    patentNumber: "US11983630B2",
    jurisdiction: "US",
    title: "Neural networks for embedded devices",
    abstract:
      "A neural network architecture is used that reduces the processing load of implementing the neural network. This network architecture may thus be used for reduced-bit processing devices. The architecture may limit the number of bits used for processing and reduce processing to prevent data overflow at individual calculations of the neural network. To implement this architecture, the number of bits used to represent inputs at levels of the network and the related filter masks may also be modified to ensure the number of bits of the output does not overflow the resulting capacity of the reduced-bit processing devices.",
    claims:
      "1. A method of generating a neural network structure including one or more input layers each associated with one or more filters, the method comprising: determining, for an architecture of a device, a bit length of a set of registers of the device used to perform arithmetic operations; selecting a number of bits to represent inputs to a layer of the neural network based on the determined bit length; selecting a number of bits to represent filter masks of the layer based on the determined bit length; and configuring the layer so that an output of the layer does not overflow the bit length of the set of registers, thereby producing a reduced-bit neural network structure deployable on the device.",
    description:
      "The disclosure relates to neural-network architectures for resource-constrained embedded devices such as vehicle inference processors. Conventional neural networks use 32-bit floating-point arithmetic that exceeds the register capacity of low-power inference chips. The present architecture tunes bit lengths of inputs and filter masks per layer so that intermediate results never overflow the device's native register width, enabling on-device inference without retraining.",
